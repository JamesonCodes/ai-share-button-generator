  <h1>Sample Article - Mobile Fixed Bottom Bar Test</h1>
  
  <!-- Note: This page is designed for testing the mobile fixed bottom bar feature -->
  <!-- Resize your browser to < 600px width or test on a mobile device to see the fixed bottom bar -->
  
  <article>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This is a test page to demonstrate the AI Share Button embed script. On desktop (viewport > 600px), the buttons will appear floating in the bottom right corner of the page. On mobile devices (viewport ≤ 600px), the buttons will appear in a fixed bottom bar that spans the full width of the screen.</p>
    <p>Click the share button to test how it sends this article to the selected AI platform with your custom prompt template.</p>
    <p>The button uses the configured URL, brand name, and prompt template to create a pre-filled prompt for the AI assistant.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 1: Understanding AI Share Buttons</h2>
    <p>AI Share buttons provide a convenient way for readers to quickly send content to their preferred AI assistant. This functionality enhances the reading experience by allowing users to analyze, summarize, or discuss articles directly with AI platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini.</p>
    <p>The implementation is lightweight and requires no backend infrastructure. The script reads configuration from data attributes and dynamically generates the appropriate buttons based on the user's preferences.</p>
    <p>Each button is styled with the official brand colors of the respective AI platform, making them easily recognizable and maintaining visual consistency with the platforms themselves.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 2: Mobile Optimization</h2>
    <p>On mobile devices, the share buttons are displayed in a fixed bottom bar to ensure they remain accessible while scrolling through long articles. This design pattern is common in mobile web applications and provides better usability than floating buttons that might be obscured or difficult to tap.</p>
    <p>The fixed bottom bar includes all essential elements: the action label (e.g., "Summarize in:"), the AI platform buttons arranged horizontally, and the attribution link. The bar has a subtle border and shadow to visually separate it from the main content.</p>
    <p>To prevent content from being hidden behind the fixed bar, the page automatically adds padding to the bottom of the body element. This ensures that users can scroll to see all content without any text being obscured.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 3: Configuration Options</h2>
    <p>The AI Share Button script supports various configuration options through data attributes. The required attributes include the URL to share and the brand name for attribution. Optional attributes allow customization of the AI platforms, prompt templates, button styles, and whether to show the attribution link.</p>
    <p>Prompt templates can include placeholders like {URL} and {BRAND} that are automatically replaced with the actual values when the button is clicked. This allows for flexible customization while maintaining consistency across different implementations.</p>
    <p>The script automatically detects the page's background color and adjusts text colors accordingly to ensure proper contrast and readability. This works for both light and dark themes.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 4: Testing Scenarios</h2>
    <p>When testing the mobile fixed bottom bar, consider the following scenarios:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scroll through the entire page to verify the bar remains fixed at the bottom</li>
      <li>Test with different numbers of AI buttons (1, 2, or 3 buttons) to ensure proper layout</li>
      <li>Verify that the buttons are easily tappable with adequate spacing</li>
      <li>Check that the last paragraph of content is visible above the fixed bar</li>
      <li>Test on actual mobile devices to ensure proper rendering and touch interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The fixed bottom bar should maintain its position regardless of scroll position, making it always accessible to users who want to share or analyze the content.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 5: Best Practices</h2>
    <p>When implementing AI Share buttons on your website, consider the following best practices:</p>
    <p>First, choose the appropriate AI platforms based on your audience's preferences. ChatGPT is widely popular, while Perplexity offers web search capabilities, and Gemini provides Google's AI integration.</p>
    <p>Second, customize the prompt template to match your content type and goals. A well-crafted prompt can help users get better results from the AI assistant and maintain proper attribution.</p>
    <p>Third, test the implementation across different devices and screen sizes to ensure consistent behavior. The mobile experience is particularly important given the increasing use of mobile devices for content consumption.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 6: Technical Implementation</h2>
    <p>The AI Share Button script is implemented as a standalone JavaScript file that can be embedded on any website. It uses vanilla JavaScript with no dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to integrate.</p>
    <p>The script automatically detects when it's running on a mobile device (viewport width ≤ 600px) and applies the appropriate styling for the fixed bottom bar. This responsive behavior ensures optimal user experience across all device types.</p>
    <p>Background color detection uses the WCAG contrast calculation formula to determine appropriate text colors. This ensures accessibility and readability regardless of the page's color scheme.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 7: User Experience Considerations</h2>
    <p>The fixed bottom bar design prioritizes user experience by keeping the share functionality always accessible. This is especially important for long-form content where users might want to share or analyze the article after reading through it.</p>
    <p>The horizontal layout of buttons on mobile makes efficient use of screen space while maintaining clear visual hierarchy. The attribution link is placed below the buttons to maintain visibility without cluttering the interface.</p>
    <p>Touch targets are sized appropriately for mobile interaction, with adequate padding and spacing to prevent accidental taps. The buttons maintain their brand colors and icons for easy recognition.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Section 8: Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This test page demonstrates the mobile fixed bottom bar implementation for AI Share buttons. The feature enhances mobile usability by providing persistent access to share functionality while reading long articles.</p>
    <p>If you're viewing this on a desktop browser, try resizing the window to less than 600px wide to see the mobile layout. Alternatively, use your browser's developer tools to simulate a mobile device viewport.</p>
    <p>The implementation is designed to be unobtrusive while remaining easily accessible, striking a balance between functionality and visual design. This ensures that users can focus on the content while having quick access to sharing options when needed.</p>
